Description: This package is made of 3 functions and its aim is to take a set of SNVs from a VCF file. SNVs are Single nucleotide variant so they can be detected by the fact that the reference and alternative allele are 1 letter only. After running the function the user will get the position of this changes and providing the length, it can be retrieved the genomica sequence from a genomic reference. The last function basically group the information and the type of mutation providing two plots and two table with the found mutations type.
